# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

This is a data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects. In this descriptive statistical analysis we used several MS Excel tools, pivot tables and graphing to visualize campaign outcomes.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze thousand crowdfunding campaigns in a short amount of time to uncover any hidden trends. Our client is interested in how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch date and founding goals. In order to provide an analysis that is easy and clear to understand to our client. We used the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes

To start our analysis we first cleaned and filtered our dataset to have a better understanding of our data. Then we proceed to use pivot tables and charts to visualize our data. 

First we analyzed the dataset per parent category by creating a pivot table and charting the data.

Fig 1.1 Outcomes by parent category

By looking at the data in Fig 1.1, we can easily identify that theater and music parent categories performed very well. Now we will do a more deeper analysis by looking into subcategories. This will allow us to provide data in areas that are more relevant to our client.

Fig 1.2 Outcomes by subcategory

As we can see in the chart, plays subcategory performed very well, making the "theater" category the most successful.

Now we created a chart based on “Outcomes on Launch Date”. Based on our data analysis we can easily identify that the month with the most successful kickstarter campaigns were May and June. However, the month of June had a higher number of failed campaigns similar to January, July and October.
