# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project

This is a data analysis on several thousand crowdfunding projects. In this descriptive statistical analysis we used several MS Excel tools, pivot tables and graphing to visualize campaign outcomes.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze thousand crowdfunding campaigns in a short amount of time to uncover any hidden trends. Our client is interested in how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch date and founding goals. In order to provide an analysis that is easy and clear to understand to our client. We used the Kickstarter dataset to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes

To start our analysis we first cleaned and filtered our dataset to have a better understanding of our data. Then we proceed to use pivot tables and charts to visualize our data. 

First we analyzed the dataset per parent category by creating a pivot table and charting the data.
